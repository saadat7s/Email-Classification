Project Description: Email Classification (NLP-based)
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify emails based on their content. The dataset (email_classification.csv) serves as the foundation for training the model, with the aim of categorizing emails into predefined classes.

Key features of the project:

Data Loading: The project employs the Pandas library to load and analyze the CSV file containing email data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various data analysis methods are used to inspect the structure, summary statistics, and overview of the dataset.
Text Preprocessing: NLP techniques are applied to preprocess email content, such as cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF or word embeddings).
Model Building: The project likely involves training a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, or Logistic Regression) to classify emails into various categories, leveraging NLP for feature extraction.
